       <strong>Hello!</strong> My name is Kristina. This is my final project for Dr. Lindgren's Writing and Digital Media course. Here you will find a portfolio of the projects I've created throughout the semester.

          <p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif">
            For my data collection project, I chose to record my music listening habits for a period of six days. I created a spreadsheet through Google Sheets, in which I recorded the the time and day, the song titles, their artists, their genres, and in what application I accessed them. I also recorded what I was doing while listening to each song, and to what degree it compelled me to dance and sing. At the end of the six days, I was not surprised to see that a large portion of the songs were those from the classic rock genre, nor that classic rock songs were the most likely have high impact ratings. There was a noticeable pattern of large chunks of time when I would listen to music, and it was often the case that the songs in these chunks would all belong to the same genre.

            Collecting data on myself was an eye-opener for me in the sense that it broadened my perception of what data can do. As a creative writing major, the word 'data' connoted long lines of complicated code on computer screens or research findings in a news article I had read. In short, I had never associated data with people. I knew there was a lot of it in the world and that I usually didn't understand it. I've become more aware of how much data is collected on the individual, how much power data can hold, and the divers ways that it can be utilized to both <em>illustrate and improve our lives.</em>

          <p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif">
             The data visualization entailed the creation of a aesthetic visual representation, using the Inkscape software, with the data I collected in the previous project. Keeping in the theme of the classic rock music genre, I decided to display my data points with the shape of a guitar acting as the base for my diagram. I added a tye-dye background for good measure, as tye-dye was also indicative of the culture during the decades of rock. The neck and body of the guitar are two separate graphs: the neck displays how much of each genre of music I listened to by day, whereas the body displays how much each genre impacted my energy by day.

          <p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif">
             Out of all of them, this was the project I most enjoyed doing. Despite it being tedious and time-consuming to perfect, <strong>I liked being able to present my data through creative expression.</strong> I think the data visualization goes to show that something as ostensibly dry and lifeless as data can become an awesome (and meaningful!) work of art. The Dear Data postcards are one excellent example of that. This project, more than anything, changed my perception of what data can be; it is a culmination of the values of an aspect of our lives. Transforming that data into something we can see and understand allows us to see and understand a little part of life, whether that is part of oneself or a facet of humanity.

            Unlike the data collection and visualization, the explained video was a group effort. My group and I chose to focus on the contemporary ethical issue of psyhcographics. I was responsible for composing the introductory portion of the video, in which I created drawings to represent the hypothetical situation of a victim of psychographics named Bob. I did research into the definition, impacts, and ethical implications of psychographics for this purpose.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif">
            Through my research for our explained video, I have gained a glimpse into what goes on "behind the scenes" of the online world. Psychographics is the exploitation of an individual's activities, interests, and opinions not only in order to customize their online experience, but also to maximize profit for companies. As we've learned from our Katz readings, data can be a powerful and destructive tool. I think it is important to distinguish the boundaries of how involved the web, such as social media platforms, should be.
